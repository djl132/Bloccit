<h1>New Post</h1>

<!-- There are a few things to note here:

@article is the actual object being edited.
There is a single hash of options. Routing options are passed in the :url hash, HTML options are passed in the :html hash. Also you can provide a :namespace option for your form to ensure uniqueness of id attributes on form elements. The namespace attribute will be prefixed with underscore on the generated HTML id.
The form_for method yields a form builder object (the f variable).
Methods to create form controls are called on the form builder object f. -->
